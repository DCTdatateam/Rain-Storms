<h1> Rainfall and water levels data</h1>

We have analysed and processed data for river water levels and rainfalls to bring out specialised custom analysis during periods of weather warnings, named storms or flood warnings. This will focus on areas within our patch that have been the most affected by the poor weather according to the data. Data is pulled from Sepa's API.
